<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One October morning Anne wakened to the realisation that she had slept for the last time under the roof of her little house. The day was too busy to indulge regret and when evening came the house was stripped and bare. Anne and Gilbert were alone in it to say farewell. Leslie and Susan and Little Jem had gone to the Glen with the last load of furniture. The sunset light streamed in through the curtainless windows.</p><p>"It has all such a heart-broken, reproachful look, hasn't it?" said Anne. "Oh, I shall be so homesick at the Glen tonight!"</p><p>"We have been very happy here, haven't we, Anne-girl?" said Gilbert, his voice full of feeling.</p></div> </div>

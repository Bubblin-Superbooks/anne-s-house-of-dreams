<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Before Owen came there used to be horrible moments--when I had been with you and Gilbert--and then had to leave you. You two would walk away together and I would walk away ALONE.

Let's have done talking about my folly. I'll never bore you with it again."</p><p>"Here is Gilbert, and you are coming back with us," said Anne, who had no intention of leaving Leslie to wander alone on the sand-bar on such a night and in such a mood. "There's plenty of room in our boat for three, and we'll tie the flat on behind."</p></div> </div>

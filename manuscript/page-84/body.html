Last night I was up to the Glen and took home two pounds of steak. I meant to have a spanking good dinner today."</p><p>"And what happened to the steak?" asked Mrs. Doctor Dave. "Did you lose it on the way home?"</p><p>"No." Captain Jim looked sheepish. "Just at bedtime a poor, ornery sort of dog came along and asked for a night's lodging. Guess he belonged to some of the fishermen 'long shore. I couldn't turn the poor cur out--he had a sore foot. So I shut him in the porch, with an old bag to lie on, and went to bed. But somehow I couldn't sleep. Come to think it over, I sorter remembered that the dog looked hungry."</p></div> </div>

"But when I haven't it just seems like wanton cruelty--though I know Phil wouldn't hurt me for the world. Oh, Marilla, I don't see how I can EVER be happy again--EVERYTHING will hurt me all the rest of my life."</p><p>"Time will help you," said Marilla, who was racked with sympathy but could never learn to express it in other than age-worn formulas.</p><p>"It doesn't seem FAIR," said Anne rebelliously.

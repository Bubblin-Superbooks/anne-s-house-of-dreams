We've picked our books up through the years, here and there, never buying one until we had first read it and knew that it belonged to the race of Joseph."</p><p>Leslie laughed--beautiful laughter that seemed akin to all the mirth that had echoed through the little house in the vanished years.</p><p>"I have a few books of father's--not many," she said. "I've read them until I know them almost by heart. I don't get many books. There's a circulating library at the Glen store--but I don't think the committee who pick the books for Mr. Parker know what books are of Joseph's race--or perhaps they don't care. It was so seldom I got one I really liked that I gave up getting any."</p></div> </div>

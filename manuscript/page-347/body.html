Anne, Anne, I never had anything to love since my mother died, except Dick's old dog--and it's so dreadful to have nothing to love--life is so EMPTY--and there's NOTHING worse than emptiness--and I might have loved you so much--and that horrible thing had spoiled it--"</p><p>Leslie was trembling and growing almost incoherent with the violence of her emotion.</p><p>"Don't, Leslie," implored Anne, "oh, don't. I understand--don't talk of it any more."</p><p>"I must--I must. When I knew you were going to live I vowed that I would tell you as soon as you were well--that I wouldn't go on accepting your friendship and companionship without telling you how unworthy I was of it. And I've been so afraid--it would turn you against me."</p></div> </div>

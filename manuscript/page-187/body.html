"Never--when you are alone?"</p><p>"No. I don't think I've ever been really lonely in my life," answered Anne. "Even when I'm alone I have real good company--dreams and imaginations and pretendings. I LIKE to be alone now and then, just to think over things and TASTE them. But I love friendship--and nice, jolly little times with people. Oh, WON'T you come to see me--often? Please do. I believe," Anne added, laughing, "that you'd like me if you knew me."</p><p>"I wonder if YOU would like ME," said Leslie seriously. She was not fishing for a compliment. She looked out across the waves that were beginning to be garlanded with blossoms of moonlit foam, and her eyes filled with shadows.</p></div> </div>

Leslie had been very distant at their parting.</p><p>But she had promised to write. Ten days after Gilbert's return the letter came.

"Does she mean that Dick's memory is really restored?"</p><p>"Not likely--since she says nothing of it," said Gilbert. "She uses the word 'successfully' from the surgeon's point of view. The operation has been performed and followed by normal results. But it is too soon to know whether Dick's faculties will be eventually restored, wholly or in part. His memory would not be likely to return to him all at once. The process will be gradual, if it occurs at all. Is that all she says?"</p></div> </div>

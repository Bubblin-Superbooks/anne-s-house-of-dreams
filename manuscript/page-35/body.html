But Miss Russell's furniture is very good and I feel sure you'll like it, Anne."</p><p>"So far, good," said Anne, nodding cautious approval. "But, Gilbert, people cannot live by furniture alone.

There is a big grove of fir trees behind it, two rows of Lombardy poplars down the lane, and a ring of white birches around a very delightful garden.

Their boughs form an arch overhead."</p></div> </div>

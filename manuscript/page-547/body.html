You see, I'd been praying for A BROTHER TWO YEARS OLDER THAN MYSELF."</p><p>"How long did it take you to get over your disappointment?" asked Anne, amid her laughter.</p><p>"Well, I had a spite at Providence for a good spell, and for weeks I wouldn't even look at the baby. Nobody knew why, for I never told. Then he began to get real cute, and held out his wee hands to me and I began to get fond of him. But I didn't get really reconciled to him until one day a school chum came to see him and said she thought he was awful small for his age. I just got boiling mad, and I sailed right into her, and told her she didn't know a nice baby when she saw one, and ours was the nicest baby in the world. And after that I just worshipped him.</p></div> </div>

Do you think I would do such a thing?"</p><p>"Oh, I don't know--you and Gilbert are such CHUMS. I don't see how you could help telling him everything."</p><p>"Everything about my own concerns--yes. But not my friends' secrets."</p><p>"I couldn't have HIM know. But I'm glad YOU know. I would feel guilty if there were anything I was ashamed to tell you. I hope Miss Cornelia won't find out. Sometimes I feel as if those terrible, kind brown eyes of hers read my very soul. Oh, I wish this mist would never lift--I wish I could just stay in it forever, hidden away from every living being. I don't see how I can go on with life. This summer has been so full. I never was lonely for a moment.</p></div> </div>

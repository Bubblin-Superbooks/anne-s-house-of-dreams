<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The First Mate uncoiled himself like a spring with a nice, throaty, comfortable sound, half purr, half meow, stretched his paws in air, turned over and coiled himself up again. "HE'll miss me when I start on the V'yage. I can't bear to think of leaving the poor critter to starve, like he was left before. If anything happens to me will you give Matey a bite and a corner, Mistress Blythe?"</p><p>"Indeed I will."</p><p>"Then that is all I had on my mind. Your Little Jem is to have the few curious things I picked up--I've seen to that. And now I don't like to see tears in those pretty eyes, Mistress Blythe. I'll mebbe hang on for quite a spell yet. I heard you reading a piece of poetry one day last winter--one of Tennyson's pieces. I'd sorter like to hear it again, if you could recite it for me."</p></div> </div>

Anne and Gilbert promised to come soon and often.</p><p>"He's a rare old fellow, isn't he?" said Gilbert, as they walked home.</p><p>"Somehow, I can't reconcile his simple, kindly personality with the wild, adventurous life he has lived," mused Anne.</p><p>"You wouldn't find it so hard if you had seen him the other day down at the fishing village. One of the men of Peter Gautier's boat made a nasty remark about some girl along the shore. Captain Jim fairly scorched the wretched fellow with the lightning of his eyes. He seemed a man transformed. He didn't say much--but the way he said it! You'd have thought it would strip the flesh from the fellow's bones. I understand that Captain Jim will never allow a word against any woman to be said in his presence."</p></div> </div>

"Why, what in the world have you to say about Dick Moore?"</p><p>"I've been thinking a great deal about him lately. Do you remember that time last summer I treated him for those carbuncles on his neck?"</p><p>"Yes--yes."</p><p>"I took the opportunity to examine the scars on his head thoroughly. I've always thought Dick was a very interesting case from a medical point of view. Lately I've been studying the history of trephining and the cases where it has been employed. Anne, I have come to the conclusion that if Dick Moore were taken to a good hospital and the operation of trephining performed on several places in his skull, his memory and faculties might be restored."</p></div> </div>

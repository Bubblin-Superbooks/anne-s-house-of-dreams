<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"How kind and thoughtful you are, Captain Jim. Nobody else--not even Gilbert"--with a shake of her head at him--"remembered that I always long for mayflowers in spring."</p><p>"Well, I had another errand, too--I wanted to take Mr. Howard back yander a mess of trout. He likes one occasional, and it's all I can do for a kindness he did me once. I stayed all the afternoon and talked to him. He likes to talk to me, though he's a highly eddicated man and I'm only an ignorant old sailor, because he's one of the folks that's GOT to talk or they're miserable, and he finds listeners scarce around here. The Glen folks fight shy of him because they think he's an infidel. He ain't that far gone exactly--few men is, I reckon--but he's what you might call a heretic. Heretics are wicked, but they're mighty int'resting.</p></div> </div>

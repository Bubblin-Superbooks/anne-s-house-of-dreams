Gilbert is going to settle at Four Winds Harbor--sixty miles from here."</p><p>"Sixty! It might as well be six hundred," sighed Diana. "I never can get further from home now than Charlottetown."</p><p>"You'll have to come to Four Winds. It's the most beautiful harbor on the Island. There's a little village called Glen St. Mary at its head, and Dr. David Blythe has been practicing there for fifty years. He is Gilbert's great-uncle, you know. He is going to retire, and Gilbert is to take over his practice. Dr. Blythe is going to keep his house, though, so we shall have to find a habitation for ourselves. I don't know yet what it is, or where it will be in reality, but I have a little house o'dreams all furnished in my imagination--a tiny, delightful castle in Spain."</p></div> </div>

And it will break my heart."</p><p>Susan did not enter into Anne's feelings at all. She was, indeed, quite rejoiced over the prospect of living at the Glen. Her one grievance against her place in the little house was its lonesome location.</p><p>"Why, Mrs. Doctor, dear, it will be splendid. The Morgan house is such a fine, big one."</p><p>"I hate big houses," sobbed Anne.</p><p>"Oh, well, you will not hate them by the time you have half a dozen children," remarked Susan calmly. "And this house is too small already for us. We have no spare room, since Mrs. Moore is here, and that pantry is the most aggravating place I ever tried to work in. There is a corner every way you turn. Besides, it is out-of-the-world down here. There is really nothing at all but scenery."</p></div> </div>

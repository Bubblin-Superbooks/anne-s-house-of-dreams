"Don't you mind if she's stiff by times--don't notice it. Remember what her life has been--and is--and must always be, I suppose, for creatures like Dick Moore live forever, I understand. You should see how fat he's got since he came home. He used to be lean enough. Just MAKE her be friends--you can do it--you're one of those who have the knack. Only you mustn't be sensitive. And don't mind if she doesn't seem to want you to go over there much. She knows that some women don't like to be where Dick is--they complain he gives them the creeps. Just get her to come over here as often as she can. She can't get away so very much--she can't leave Dick long, for the Lord knows what he'd do--burn the house down most likely.</p></div> </div>

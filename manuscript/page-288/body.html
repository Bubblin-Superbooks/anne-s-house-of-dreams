But there are times--not always, but now and again--when I almost have to believe that Leslie doesn't--doesn't like me. Sometimes I surprise a look in her eyes that seems to show resentment and dislike--it goes so quickly--but I've seen it, I'm sure of that. And it hurts me, Captain Jim. I'm not used to being disliked--and I've tried so hard to win Leslie's friendship."</p><p>"You have won it, Mistress Blythe. Don't you go cherishing any foolish notion that Leslie don't like you. If she didn't she wouldn't have anything to do with you, much less chumming with you as she does. I know Leslie Moore too well not to be sure of that."</p></div> </div>

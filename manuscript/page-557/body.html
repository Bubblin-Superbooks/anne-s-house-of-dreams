It was quite a tragedy. Suppose he cried? Suppose Susan did not know just exactly what to do for him? Susan was calm and serene.</p><p>"I have had as much experience with him as you, Mrs. Doctor, dear, have I not?"</p><p>"Yes, with him--but not with other babies.

It's quite curious now to recall how lightly I took all those babies and their woes."</p></div> </div>

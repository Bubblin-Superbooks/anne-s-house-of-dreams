As Susan said the other day, 'I feel like a fly coming to live in the sun--dazed-like.' It's all so incredible. I've read the letter a score of times and every time it's just the same--I can't believe my own eyes. Oh, Gilbert, you were right--so right. I can see that clearly enough now--and I'm so ashamed of myself--and will you ever really forgive me?"</p><p>"Anne, I'll shake you if you don't grow coherent. Redmond would be ashamed of you. WHAT has happened?"</p></div> </div>

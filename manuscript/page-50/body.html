How those dear old days at Patty's Place come back when I'm talking to you, Anne! What fun we had!"</p><p>"Have you been to Patty's Place lately?"</p><p>"Oh, yes, I go often. Miss Patty and Miss Maria still sit by the fireplace and knit. And that reminds me--we've brought you a wedding gift from them, Anne. Guess what it is."</p><p>"I never could. How did they know I was going to be married?"</p><p>"Oh, I told them. I was there last week. And they were so interested. Two days ago Miss Patty wrote me a note asking me to call; and then she asked if I would take her gift to you. What would you wish most from Patty's Place, Anne?"</p></div> </div>

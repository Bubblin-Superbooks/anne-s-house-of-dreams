<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"It won't hurt so much always, Anne."</p><p>"The thought that it may stop hurting sometimes hurts me worse than all else, Marilla."</p><p>"Yes, I know, I've felt that too, about other things. But we all love you, Anne. Captain Jim has been up every day to ask for you--and Mrs. Moore haunts the place--and Miss Bryant spends most of her time, I think, cooking up nice things for you. Susan doesn't like it very well. She thinks she can cook as well as Miss Bryant."</p><p>"Dear Susan! Oh, everybody has been so dear and good and lovely to me, Marilla. I'm not ungrateful--and perhaps--when this horrible ache grows a little less--I'll find that I can go on living."</p></div> </div>

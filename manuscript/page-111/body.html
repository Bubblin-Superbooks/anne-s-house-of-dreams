"I've enj'yed this evening something tremenjus."</p><p>"You must come often to see us," said Anne.</p><p>"I wonder if you'd give that invitation if you knew how likely I'll be to accept it," Captain Jim remarked whimsically.</p><p>"Which is another way of saying you wonder if I mean it," smiled Anne. "I do, 'cross my heart,' as we used to say at school."</p><p>"Then I'll come. You're likely to be pestered with me at any hour. And I'll be proud to have you drop down and visit me now and then, too. Gin'rally I haven't anyone to talk to but the First Mate, bless his sociable heart.

You're young and I'm old, but our souls are about the same age, I reckon. We both belong to the race that knows Joseph, as Cornelia Bryant would say."</p></div> </div>

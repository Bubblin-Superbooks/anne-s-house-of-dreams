I will not have you worried, and that blessed child upset in consequence, for any number of legs."</p><p>"Oh, you must go to your sister at once, Susan. I can get a girl from the cove, who will do for a time."</p><p>"Anne, will you let me come and stay with you while Susan is away?" exclaimed Leslie. "Do! I'd love to--and it would be an act of charity on your part. I'm so horribly lonely over there in that big barn of a house. There's so little to do--and at night I'm worse than lonely--I'm frightened and nervous in spite of locked doors. There was a tramp around two days ago."</p></div> </div>

"Perhaps Captain Jim sees us both through the rose-colored spectacles of his love for us. But we can try to live up to his belief in us, at least."</p><p>"Do you remember, Anne," said Leslie slowly, "that I once said--that night we met on the shore--that I hated my good looks? I did--then. It always seemed to me that if I had been homely Dick would never have thought of me. I hated my beauty because it had attracted him, but now--oh, I'm glad that I have it. It's all I have to offer Owen,--his artist soul delights in it. I feel as if I do not come to him quite empty-handed."</p></div> </div>

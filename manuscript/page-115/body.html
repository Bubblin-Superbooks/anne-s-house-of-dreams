Why don't you folks tell me to take in the slack of my jaw and go home?"</p><p>The laughter of the goodnights died away. Anne and Gilbert walked hand in hand around their garden. The brook that ran across the corner dimpled pellucidly in the shadows of the birches. The poppies along its banks were like shallow cups of moonlight. Flowers that had been planted by the hands of the schoolmaster's bride flung their sweetness on the shadowy air, like the beauty and blessing of sacred yesterdays.

And I'm so glad that we are not the first who have kept bridal tryst here!"</p></div> </div>

It's about two miles from Glen St. Mary, and there's another mile between it and the light-house. We won't have many neighbors, Anne. There's only one house near us and I don't know who lives in it. Shall you be lonely when I'm away?"</p><p>"Not with that light and that loveliness for company. Who lives in that house, Gilbert?"</p><p>"I don't know. It doesn't look--exactly--as if the occupants would be kindred spirits, Anne, does it?"</p><p>The house was a large, substantial affair, painted such a vivid green that the landscape seemed quite faded by contrast. There was an orchard behind it, and a nicely kept lawn before it, but, somehow, there was a certain bareness about it.</p></div> </div>

It slipped out before I thought."</p><p>"So Miss Russell's little white house is YOUR house of dreams," said Leslie wonderingly. "_I_ had a house of dreams once--but it was a palace," she added, with a laugh, the sweetness of which was marred by a little note of derision.</p><p>"Oh, I once dreamed of a palace, too," said Anne. "I suppose all girls do. And then we settle down contentedly in eight-room houses that seem to fulfill all the desires of our hearts--because our prince is there. YOU should have had your palace really, though--you are so beautiful. You MUST let me say it--it has to be said--I'm nearly bursting with admiration. You are the loveliest thing I ever saw, Mrs. Moore."</p></div> </div>
